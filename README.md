# IMDb Browser

A full-stack IMDb browser web application where you can look up details of the **Top 1000 IMDb movies and TV shows**.  

The dataset comes from [Kaggle â€“ IMDb Top 1000 Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows).  
I transformed this dataset into a PostgreSQL database hosted on **Supabase**, built a backend API with **Flask + SQLAlchemy**, and created a modern **React + Vite** frontend with **Tailwind CSS** and **TypeScript**.

**Live Website: [imdb-browser-app.vercel.app](https://imdb-browser-app.vercel.app)**

*Please note that render server may take 50 seconds to spin up.  
You will see mock data in the meantime. Please be patient, thank you!*
